# autobump
An exteremely unoptimized script to automatically bump a server via Disboard

## PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS. AUTOMATING ACCOUNTS BREAKS DISCORD TOS AND AUTOMATIC BUMPING IS AGAINST DISBOARD'S RULES. THIS IS SIMPLY A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND TEST OF DISCUM  

## Important info:
Use the following command to install the required discum library: ```python -m pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M.git#egg=discum```  
Edit the TOKEN, guildID and channelID values to match that of your userbot and server.  
Do not change the botID unless you intend to automate something other than Disboard bumps  
If you would like to automate a different command, change the query and s.get values  
#if you would like to change the interval, check the comment of line 13 of the code
